# CNN-Model-Detecting-Liveness-of-Fingerprint-using-Deep-Learnig-
Here I have designed a neural network with image inputs of size(300x300). The network is trained with a set of training images of fingerprints (13,618 in total) collected from different sensors. The data is collected in 2 sets of fake and live. The desired output, that is, whether the fingerprint is live or fake, is given by the trained network. I have tried to implement a SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION learning model by using feedforward and backpropagation algorithm technique. Here I have used the KERAS library which is already written in python.
